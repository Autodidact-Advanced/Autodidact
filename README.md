# Autodidact
An advanced Learning System
A completely functioning interactive software tool chain for enhancing the comprehension power and making quizzes at all levels, specially developed for on-line and off-line daily testing in a particular subject area (tested in Classical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics, Condensed Matter Physics, Basic Electronics, Mathematical Physics etc.). It is a multi-purpose software package which has full LaTex support. It can be used for taking and practising on-line examinations (CBT) like, SAT, GRE, NET, GATE, NEET, PMT, IIT-JEE, Class-tests etc. or any examination prevalent in the country. 

In brief, the Autodidact improves the learning skills by improving memory capabilities among pre-graduates and graduates and make them more competent in their field of interest. Experience demonstrates that in institutes most of the time and effort is wasted, even few of the courses run/go not fully taught, here the Autodidact comes handy and results in a dramatic change and saves your time. From the students point of view on the day of test they usually forget even the opening word(s), formulae ... with time, short focus... etc. in these common conditions regular practising with Autodidact is the remedy, before they forget everything. Autodidact targets to those average students which require some kind of training and aspire to outperform by providing them a rapid preparation system in a short span of time. Another biggest advantage is that most people learn at the most during the preparation of its input file, as it require ones complete focus, as a natural consequence.

Features and capabilities
-------------------------
Embodies a powerful method of preparation for competitive and class examinations.

Mathematical typing (LaTex based) with fully randomized options.

High quality of image inserts; randomized tables / column matching, MCQ, fill in the blanks with user friendly clear interface with response time of micro seconds.

Universities/Institutes can utilize it as their part of educational (advantage) package and can put institutes's logo, slogan etc. on it.

Institutes/one can easily monitor, how well their students have performed and put the emphases on the weaker part of the curriculum taught and can hint about the effectiveness of the pedagogy adopted so far. It helps to keep their core study material short and simple.  

No data base like intricacies, simple to use text file based input and highest portability.

Runs on all major Linux distributions.

Currently Autodidact is provided with single user  licence in student, institutional and commercial versions with demo and instruction manual (for overseas a soft copy). Licence fee for institutes (registered professors) are nearly half of the usual single user licences fees' provided as a special promotional package. Just support the opensource community as it has future. Special promotional distributions for a class of students are provided at very affordable prices at one go. If more than 100 licences are needed at one go, it is better to be an Autodidact supported institute, which brings its own additional advantages. Every Autodidact licence is supported for two years including updates and upgrades. Special features could be implemented on request unless it is counter-intuitive to the process of common learning. For malfunctioning, bugs etc. reported will be updated/upgraded as soon as possible.
